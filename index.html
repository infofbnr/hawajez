        "Hawajez" (Ø­ÙˆØ§Ø¬Ø²) refer to roadblocks or checkpoints that are set up by security forces, political groups, or protestors in various parts of Lebanon. These roadblocks can cause traffic disruptions, delays, and even safety concerns for motorists. They are often set up to control the movement of people or vehicles, either as part of a protest, security measure, or law enforcement.
